# Workflow Automation with Python â€“ Course Projects

This repository showcases my work from the **DATA 2399: Workflow Automation with Python** course. Throughout the semester, I learned how to automate repetitive tasks, extract data from the web, integrate automation libraries, and design end-to-end workflows for real-world applications.

## Topics Covered
- Python scripting for automation
- String manipulation and regular expressions
- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup and pandas
- File and task automation with Python
- Working with Excel files using `openpyxl`
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`
- Designing custom automation workflows

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `BeautifulSoup`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`, `re`
- Automation libraries: `PyAutoGUI`, `os`, `shutil`, `Schedule`,`Time`, `smtplib`, `ssl`, `email.mime`

## Highlights
- Created a custom scraper to extract structured set data from a web source
- Used pandas to clean and analyze product data
- Designed scripts to automate repeatable scraping and cleaning tasks
- Applied regular expressions for targeted string cleaning and transformation
- Automated email notifications using `smtplib` and `email.mime` to send formatted messages as part of workflow execution

## What I Learned
This course taught me how to think like an automation designer. I learned how to break down tedious workflows and rebuild them with code. I developed a deeper understanding of how Python can be used not just for analysis, but for streamlining everyday digital tasks in meaningful ways.
