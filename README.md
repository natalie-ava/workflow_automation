# Workflow Automation with Python â€“ Course Projects

This repository showcases my work from the **DATA 2399: Workflow Automation with Python** course. Throughout the semester, I learned how to automate repetitive tasks, extract data from the web, integrate automation libraries, and design end-to-end workflows for real-world applications.

## Topics Covered
- Python scripting for automation
- String manipulation and regular expressions
- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup and pandas
- File and task automation with Python
- Using automation libraries (e.g., Schedule, Time)
- Designing custom automation workflows
- API automation and cloud task scheduling

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- BeautifulSoup, pandas, re, os, shutil
- APIs, automation libraries

## Highlights
- Created a custom scraper to extract structured set data from a web source
- Used pandas to clean and analyze product data
- Designed modular scripts to automate repeatable scraping and cleaning tasks
- Applied regular expressions for targeted string cleaning and transformation

## What I Learned
This course taught me how to think like an automation designer. I learned how to break down tedious workflows and rebuild them with code. I developed a deeper understanding of how Python can be used not just for analysis, but for streamlining everyday digital tasks in meaningful ways.
